        This page used by students to style and prepare their work for publishing on <a href="/">The Finch</a>. This
        page makes formatting posts for web-publication easy using <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, a lightweight markup language. The markdown file
        and a <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> heading
        are then processed in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator.

# Use hashtags to make headings

## More hashtags make smaller headings

### See what I mean?

## Basic styles

Go ahead, play around with the editor! Be sure to check out **bold** and *italic* styling, or even [links](https://google.com). You can type the Markdown syntax, use the toolbar, or use shortcuts like `cmd-b` or `ctrl-b`.

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight interesting parts of the piece. They are usually short and are come before the text they are quoting.

> Blockquotes use a greater than symbol at the start of the line

## HTML

You can also use *actual* `HTML` in this editor. That's handy for a few special styles.

<span class='dropcap'>U</span>se a `<span>` tag with `class="dropcap"` to make those fancy big letters at the start of a section. If the first word is two letters, dropcap the whole word. Otherwise, just do the first letter. Also, be careful, dropcaps look *funky* if the paragraph doesn't completely surround them.

<span class='indent'>Sometimes</span> you may want to indent a line. Or leave a tab-style <span class='indent'>space</span> in the middle of a line. That style is sometime used in poetry. To do that, use the special indent class.
