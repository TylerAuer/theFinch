Imagine… flying with fairies, fighting evil queens, and singing a good old song. All you need is a good book. Monday, September 17, through Thursday, September 20, was the Enchanted Forest Book Fair. The entrance to the book fair was very inviting, with a festive rainbow of balloons and an inflatable unicorn, enticing families to come in and browse the countless books. Inside the fair, there was a very special guest: Mankini the Gnome from the movie Sherlock Gnomes! Any child who found this special gnome could enter their name in a raffle to win a prize.

There were books for all ages, ranging from Pre-K to Teens! There were multiple genres as well, from realistic fiction, to non-fiction, and fantasy.

On Wednesday afternoon, students enjoyed a read aloud by Mrs. Millerick, and Ms. Fredericks.

> If you found the gnome you could put your name into a raffle. I don't know what the raffle is for. Sorry.

To provide more information, here is a transcript of the interview between the author of this article and a student.

**Charles Raers (CR):** So, what did you like the most about the book fair?

**Student (S)**: I enjoyed the books and I appreciated the time that they put into the decorations. I really liked petting the unicorn’s head!

**CR:** I have heard something about a gnome hunt. Can you elaborate on that?

**S:** It was Mankini from Sherlock Gnomes. If you found the gnome you could put your name into a raffle. I don’t know what the raffle is for. Sorry.

**CR:** That’s okay. Did you find the gnome?

**S:** Yes. It was in an obvious location, but well disguised.

**CR:** Can you recommend any books for the readers?

**S:** I would recommend They Lost Their Heads by Carlyn Beccia to anyone who likes both history and horror. It is about what happened to famous people’s body parts, like Vincent van Gogh’s ear, and Albert Einstein’s brain.

**CR:** Did you attend the reading session with Mrs. Millerick and Ms. Fredericks?

**S:** No, I only attended the Book Fair itself.

**CR:** Thank you for this interview.

**S:** You’re welcome.
