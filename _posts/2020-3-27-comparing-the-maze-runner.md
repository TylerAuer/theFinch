<span class="dropcap">E</span>verybody notices things in our lives that don’t make sense, things that you don’t think you can live without. In the *Maze Runner* by James Dashner, the entrapped Gladers get supplies once a week, and with no way out except a maze. In *Created He Them* by Alice Jones the people are stuck in a dystopian world with food rations and poverty. In both the *Maze Runner* by James Dashner and *Created He Them* by Alice Jones the authors suggest that even when there are short supplies and outdated appliances, you can still find ways to survive. 

When reading both texts a recurring theme is a lack of resources. In *Created He Them*, Alice Jones writes, “It seemed such a long time since the electricity had always worked . . . The co-op had not had chocolate for over two years. Neither of the boys had ever tasted it.”

When reading you can tell that their family lives in a state of poverty and lack of resources with little food. In the *Maze Runner* James Dashner describes one of the buildings like so, “The place reeked of dust and mildew---a big contrast to the pleasant smells outside. Flickering fluorescent lights shine from the ceiling” (P. 17). James also mentions the Box, “Once a *week*, we get supplies, clothes, some food” (P. 42). He italicized the word "week" trying to emphasize the fact that they couldn't survive on their own, they needed the people who sent them supplies. In the other short story the family also relies on the government for food, just like the Gladers. This makes me think that although they may not be the most supplied or advanced, they manage to survive with what they have.

> Overall, in both texts the population was in need of help. But the people keep going, working, surviving, thriving. It shows that although you may not be in the best situation you can make the best of what you have and have a good life.

Although they don’t have the fanciest lifestyle they still have a life. In the *Maze Runner* the buildings aren’t up to date. “He finally forced himself to look over at the haggard building” (P. 13). Although the conditions aren’t exactly to par they still have a home. “He stood up and walked past Chuck toward the old building; shack was a better word for the place” (P. 15).

When reading you can tell that the Glade isn’t a five star hotel, but they manage to make the best of what they have. In *Created He Them* they also have short supplies, with low food and little electricity. “Just at dusk the electric light came on for the first time for three days, and she woke them up to see them--they loved the electric lights.'' Although her husband has a job for the government, they can’t afford to live in a nice neighborhood, they still have poor electricity and food rations. “The stock market had closed irregular, with rails down an average of two points and stocks off three.” While reading you can tell that it isn’t just them, the whole economy is falling apart, but their family makes the best of it, living day to day. In both stories although they don’t have the most resources they find a way to keep going and surviving, making the best of what they have.

Overall, in both texts the population was in need of help. But the people keep going, working, surviving, thriving. It shows that although you may not be in the best situation you can make the best of what you have and have a good life. They use hard work and determination to make the best of what they have, showing persistence. In conclusion, in *Created He Them* by Alice Jones and the *Maze Runner* by James Dashner, everybody manages to survive in tough situations, showing that no matter what, you can find a way to survive.
