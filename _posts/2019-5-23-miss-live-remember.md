I miss  
My loyal friend  
Whom I haven’t seen  
Or talked to 
In five years, who chatted  
With me and shared many happy  
Memories  

I miss  
My hardworking grandmother  
Who passed away  
When I was six, who sliced  
Our apples and served them  
Never to her own  
Self  

I miss  
The undying beauty  
Of Taiwan  
The tall buildings and  
The lush-filled mountains  
The scent of home  
Everywhere  

I miss  
Every touch of happiness  
I’ve ever received  
The carefree  
Times that went by  
The days without increasing  
Nostalgia  

I regret  
Meeting my mistakes  
Moments that would shame,  
Like heavy weights  
The realization  
That I’ve done something  
Wrong  

I live  
These days of stress  
Endless pile of essays and numerous  
Applications each filled out  
Selling away my energy, waiting  
For the one day of relief;  
Graduation  

I see  
Mortarboards and robes  
My parents’  
Wide smiles and my classmates’  
Prideful grins, knowing we have worked  
Hard for this  
Day  

Then I will remember  
Each moment with you  
That I’ve used up before  
We part for new  
Friends and schools; the days  
I’ll remember until I meet my  
End
