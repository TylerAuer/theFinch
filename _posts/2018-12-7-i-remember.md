snippet: An escape fraught with lies in search of truthful safety. Rhythms of the ocean reflecting the turbulence of adolescence. The love and loss of the elderly. Stories of human experience told through poetry all at once deep and lovely, powerful and fragile.

## I REMEMBER
i remember  
it was cold that day.  
freezing.  
my frail body shaking  
despite layers of cloth that  
strung me to my mother’s back.  
i cried.  
i remember  
she pat my back,  
lovingly whispering “괜찮아” in korean.  
*it’s ok.*  
<span class="indent">another lie.</span>  
i remember  
the salt from my tears  
mixed with the rainwater  
above the yalu river  
quenching my thirst,  
and my mother’s thirst for <span class="indent">freedom.</span>  
i remember curling up into a ball  
to stop the pains jolting  
up my stomach.  
i don’t remember seeing my mother’s feet:  
blistered,  
blue from the icy river,  
blood drying on the insides of her shoes  
forming tiny knives that bit  
at the bottoms of her too-tight shoes.  
the harsh wind blew through her hair,  
gave her aches  
like a hammer knocking at a stubborn nail  
refusing to be pinned into the wall.  
*tap. tap. tap.*  
i don’t remember my mother speaking to the authorities,  
her voice soft and pleading  
like silk flapping in the wind.  
i don’t remember my mother’s screams  
and her calluses from soap on too many clothes and dishes.  
i don’t remember  
because my mother gave her freedom  
for me.  
i remember  
waking up in a new town  
far from my home in north korea.  
i remember making a new life  
with my thai friends, laughing over a bowl  
of fried noodles.

## MEMORIES
it’s the salty air blowing through my hair,  
it’s the shining sun framed by brilliant blue,  
it’s the warm sand drowning my toes,  
it’s the freedom for me to be me,  
and it’s the wonderful harmony of all four  
that leaves me longing to return to  
my childhood by the sea.  

i sit by the rocks,  
watching the waves bring me treasures  
like a child proudly holding out her lost marble.  
her soft hands gently place the shells  
down at my feet. i lift my head to  
hear familiar light laughter like  
<span class="indent">tinkling bells</span>  
floating out from far down the beach,  
tens of miles away.  
i wait for it to come again, until i realize it’s me  
not ten miles, but ten years  
ago. i see her run,  
chasing the waves. just a game.  
i see her hair fly behind her as she  
<span class="indent">slips</span>  
<span class="indent">falls</span>  
<span class="indent">yells</span>  
to nobody,  
wind silencing her  
as she lays in the sand.  
there’s a scream;  
a long, high-pitched scream echoing in the tight room  
that i once thought of as open,  
<span class="indent">free.</span>  
and then i’m me again,  
invisible and helpless to the people  
of my past.  

I Found Myself.  

## THE WEEPING WILLOW
The worn out man slumps his shoulders  
and reaches  
down  
into the shimmering lake.  
His leaves touch the surface  
like fingertips gently brushing against  
a cheek; he performs a dance,  
gracefully swaying with the wind  
swishing his light branches  
to make music. But through his facade of  
happiness, he grieves the loss of another for  
eternity. A secret nobody will ever know.  
The majestic figure  
with its twisted, gnarly branches,  
wrinkly with old age:  
each leaf like a tear  
dripping down into the puddle at its  
<span class="indent">feet.</span>  
But through all his misery,  
he still stands,  
resisting the urge to fall,  
to give into the sadness;  
instead, he cries it away,  
aging with every passing year,  
until he breaks  
from the burden he carries  
upon his back.
