<span class="dropcap">N</span>early seventy years ago, in the depths of a freezing cold Finnish winter, the resilient Finnish army was able to fend off the might of the Soviet military for nearly four months before succumbing to sheer numbers and military power. The war was fought from 1939-1940 and resulted in a Soviet victory and Finland ceding 11% of its territory to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union lost much face over this operation; they lost nearly 400,000 soldiers, tanks and aircraft! This war took place in one of the coldest climates in the world; it demonstrated the resilience of the Finnish people and the brutality of weather. Even so, this caused Hitler to underestimate the Soviets during his invasion of Russia, which eventually led to the defeat of the Axis powers.

Fearful of the Nazi expansion in Europe, the Soviet Union wanted to fortify its western borders. The Soviet Prime Minister requested that Finland cede some of its eastern territory and a few islands for the Russians to fortify in return for a large swath of Russian land. Suspicious of Stalin’s intentions, the Finns refused the offer. Then, on November 26th, 1939, an unidentified group shelled a Soviet guard post near the Finnish border. This event sparked the fire that would become a devastating war between the Soviet Union and Finland.

> After four months, the soviets had finally achieved their goal, but at a much larger price than what they had expected.

The tactics the Soviet Union tried to employ were ineffective to the Finns, who crippled their counterparts with a combination of guerilla tactics and well-placed fortifications. The Finns had the advantage of fighting on their home turf and used the guerilla tactics and geography to hold off the Soviet invasion for an extraordinary amount of time. In the “Home Front,” women knit clothes, tended to the farms, and played as important as a role as the fighting on the front lines. The Russians attempted to copy the Germans and use Blitzkrieg tactics on Finland but without a large amount of well-paved roads, the advance stopped in its tracks. Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, the commander in chief of the Finnish army, established a defensive line known as the Mannerheim Line. This line of trenches and defensive structure repelled and massacred waves upon waves of Soviet battalions. Finnish troops methodically struck and cut off sections of the Russian train of reinforcements. But the Finnish troops’ most powerful weapon was not a tank or a defensive position; it was the bitter Finnish winter.

In Finland, where temperatures can drop down to -58˚ Fahrenheit, warmth and food are extremely important. At the time of the war, temperatures were freezing, the Soviets weren’t prepared for the cold, their uniforms stuck out in the snow (compared to the camouflaged Finns) and they didn’t have the nutritious food needed to fight in those conditions. The Finnish soldiers had grown up in harsh conditions and knew how to survive. On the other hand, the Soviet troops had little to none experience and didn’t have any hot, rich food. As Napoleon once said, “An army marches on its stomach.” This quote explains how it is not the tactics or manpower needed to win a war but the coordination of food, and resources, which the Soviets had very little of. In what’s known as the “Sausage War,” the Soviet troops, instead of taking an opportunity to cripple the Finnish army, disobeyed direct orders and went for the field kitchens where there was hot sausage soup cooking, which showed how malnourished the Russian troops were. Even with Russian superiority in military technology and troops, the Finns inflicted heavy casualties before finally surrendering to the sheer numbers and power of the Soviet Union.

After four months, the Soviets had finally achieved their goal, but at a much larger price than what they had expected. They had lost nearly 400,000 men and military equipment compared to the meager 70,000 men Finland lost! After the war, the Finns agreed to the Moscow Peace Treaty, which forced Finland to cede 11% of it’s territory to the Soviets. The war finally ended on March 13, 1940. The invasion had been a great embarrassment for the Soviets. However, with the outcome of the Winter War, Hitler underestimated the might of the Soviet Union and invaded it without expecting such a strong military resistance, which later lost him the World War II. The Winter War was an extraordinary failure for the Soviets, a victory for the Finns, and may have been a key factor in the outcome of World War II.
