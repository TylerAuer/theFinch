The golden glow of sunlight seeped through the branches of a tree, sprinkling the ground with little pockets of light. The sky had a reddish, orange tone with the sun creeping up behind a white building as if it were trying to surprise it. It would have been quite beautiful if today had not been the day I had dreaded for the past few months.  

Piano recital day.

The idea of the piano recital cast a dark shadow over my mind, erasing all previous thoughts. If only I could only skip today and never return.

> The smooth body of the piano sparkled as the light hit the frame. Rows of chairs were set up before the piano. I shuddered with the thought that soon I would be sitting on a leather bench, playing that grand piano, in front of a sold-out audience.

“I’m nervous,” I told my parents as we walked up the stairs to the performance hall. My chest had already started to tighten.

“Just think about the afterparty,” said my mom, trying to distract me.

We reached the top of the staircase. Inside a large room was a black grand piano, with its lid propped up. The smooth body of the piano sparkled as the light hit the frame. Rows of chairs were set up before the piano. I shuddered with the thought that soon I would be sitting on a leather bench, playing that grand piano, in front of a sold-out audience.

“Arthur!” my teacher shouted over the noise as she saw me.

She directed me to a seat in a row filled with the other anxious students.

HER FINAL RESOUNDING NOTE WAS MY KNELL, MARKING MY IMPENDING DOOM.

Before long, our teacher stood up and spoke a few words and ending with, “Enjoy the recital!”

Even though she said it with considerable cheer, the words seemed almost sinister, adding to my anxiety. First up were several young children who played short, cute, songs. I silently counted down the swiftly dwindling number of students remaining before my performance. I picked up my sheet music to review when I noticed my palms were filled with sweat. The girl beside me stood up and proceeded to perform to a perfection of one of Clementi’s Sonatinas from Opus. 36. Her final resounding note was my knell, marking my impending doom. She bowed and then sat down.

My turn.

I stood up, grasping my book tightly in one hand, the other hand hanging loosely at my side as I walked towards the piano. I handed my teacher my piano book. She gave an encouraging nod to me and flipped open the book to my song. I turned away and stood in front of dozens of faces watching me intently. I bowed. I sat down on the leather cushion of the seat. The keys seemed foreign to my shaky fingers.

Don’t mess up, I told myself, Don’t mess up.

I wiped my hands on my pants, and placed my hands on the pristine white keys and went through a silent practice run of the beginning.

The more seconds that passed by, the more anxious I became.

It’s now or never, I thought.

I began. I played the notes clearly and precisely. My sweaty fingers hit the keys to bring out the pianos and fortes, the smooth and staccato rhythms. I tried to make everything perfect. I had to. I couldn’t mess up in front of all those people, in front of my teacher, in front of my parents. So far so good. Now, the middle part of the song. The song moved onto a section with particularly tricky fingering. That was when I messed up.

I froze.

The eyes of the crowd bore into my back. I stared at the keys blankly. I wanted to yell out of frustration but managed to contain myself. My obnoxiously loud heart pounded; if only it had pounded this loud earlier when I made my mistake- so the audience would have failed to hear it. I wanted to curl up into a ball in the corner; to close my eyes and just forget, forget that it had ever happened, but I continued. Silence hung in the air as I reoriented myself. I know what I had done wrong and I tried again. To no avail.

I panicked even more. Conflicted thoughts flew through my mind. Should I try again or should I skip the part? I didn’t know what to do. I was running out of time. Finally, I accepted that I had played it wrong and tried to make the best of it by moving on to the next segment. Relieved of my troubling thoughts, the right dynamics, posture, fingering, and most importantly, calm slowly returned. The last notes of the song were delivered beautifully.

“You played quite well!” my teacher exclaimed after the recital.

“I messed up really badly,” I told her.

“But you did finish the piece,” she replied with a smile.

I feel grateful that it is all over, even though I failed. But with failure comes a lesson. A lesson of endurance, to stay afloat against all odds. Piano recitals are an opportunity to show my unique take on music. Even if I play something wrong, it can still be beautiful.

A few days later, arriving home from school, I closed the door of my family’s car. The sunlight streamed through the branches of the tree, creating little pockets of light along the cement path. The sky had a tone of reddish orange. Just like that one fateful day. I flashed back to that moment where everything had seemed to fall apart from failure. Even so, I smiled. I learned my lesson: things can be beautiful with failure too.
