I feel  
the heavy, humid air  
against my skin,  
dampening it.  

The sun brings balmy heat,  
but stays invisible,  
clouded  
by hulking masses  
of silvery-grey.  

As we speed along,  
a blissful breeze,  
delightfully gentle;  
brushes across my face,  
bringing relief from the immense heat.  

The whirring of motors is incessant;  
small cars and motorcycles  
swarm the narrow streets,  
surrounding us  
entirely.  

As we speed past the market  
aromas of spices,  
basil, star anise, fennel seeds, and  
Szechuan pepper cloud my senses,  
rich and warm  

Vendors beckon;  
selling foods rich with flavors  
only found  
in the old streets of Taiwan;  

Steadily,  
aged concrete is replaced  
by lush, emerald peaks,  
their elegant beauty enhanced by the setting sun  
who gilds the ridges with his coppery luster  

On a motorcycle ride through Formosa,  
I feel at home.
