Seven mysterious, hooded people gathered in a room. One of them said, “Well, where is it?” Another one, clearly the leader, put down a holographic image and responded, “Here it is. Project Achilles. The finest of all plans. We will crush the Galacticans once and for all!” Then they closed the hologram and went their separate ways.

## Chapter 1

“No, Sergeant Seth, you’re not getting a promotion,” said Jax.

“But sir, I meet all of the requirements to make the rank of Captain!” protested Sergeant Seth.

“Fine. But only after I meet with Queen Liora,” Jax said.

“Yes, sir!” Seth exclaimed. Jax proceeded to the throne room to meet the queen, who had called him there for an emergency meeting with the commanders of the kingdom’s military. He placed his hand on the scanner, and typed in the password. The blast doors slid open with a hiss and Jax entered the throne room.

The throne room was a well-designed room, created by Jax himself. In the middle of the room, Queen Liora sat on a throne made of diamond and the purest, finest gold ever. In the corner was the command center, filled with holographic maps, camera feeds, and computers showing readouts from every section of the Serapian-Galactican border.

> "Here is is. Project Achilles. The Finest of all plans. We will crush the Galacticans once and for all!"

In briefing area, 4 high ranking officers were discussing something. The Serapian rank system worked in a weird way. Even though Jax had the title of “Grand General”, he was officially the leader of the entire armed forces. The leaders of the individual branches had either the title “General”,  “Lieutenant General”, or “Admiral”. These officers could command their branch, but none of the others. When Jax gave a command, they had to drop whatever they were doing and follow it. Queen Liora had the final say in the military. She was the Commander in Chief, and could give orders to anyone in the armed forces, though she generally let Jax do the commanding.

Jax walked over to the briefing area and asked the nearest officer, Lieutenant General Kyzer of the Serapian Special Forces, “What’s going on?”

Kyzer responded, “There has been a security breach Jax. The Galacticans have infiltrated our defenses and have stolen the Holomap.” “Have you locked down the border?” asked Jax.

“Yes, but the thief escaped the border before we activated the emergency protocol,” replied Kyzer. “The council has voted to go to war with the Galacticans,” he said.

“What!? They have 10 soldiers for every one of our soldiers!” Jax exclaimed.

“I know, Jax, but they can plan a full-scale attack with that map,” said Kyzer.

Jax said, “Thanks, Kyzer.” Kyzer went back to chatting with General Jake of the Army, Lieutenant General Soraia of the Air and Space Force and Admiral Ridge of the Navy.

Jax headed over to Queen Liora’s throne. “Liora, I just heard about the decision, and I think that it would be wise not to declare war unless the Galacticans attack us with that intel. I can remotely change the data on the map, and set up decoy defenses. That way, we will get a reason to declare war without Serapia getting harmed,” Jax said.

“That is a good idea. You may proceed,” the queen replied.

Jax entered the command center, and began fiddling with the computers. Kyzer, Jake, Ridge, and Soraia joined him. The 5 officers and the queen had been friends ever since school. They sat down at their computers and started working on a top-secret project that not even the royal advisors knew about. The only people who knew were Soraia, Jax, Kyzer, Jake, Ridge, and Queen Liora. Pretty soon, Jax had completed setting up the trap, and went to bed.

## Chapter 2

The next day, Jax woke up to alarms ringing. He immediately jumped up, and ran to the central tower command post. He reached the bridge and barked, “Status report!” The operators responded one by one.

“Deflector shield stable.”

“Hanger secured.”

“Decoy traps defused.”

Jax immediately knew that it was the Galacticans. He yelled through his comlink, “Open fire.” Soon, the sound of gunfire filled the air. Jax could see bombers rushing out of the hangar bay doors, and bombing the Galacticans.

He noticed that the Galacticans had realized that they had been tricked, and rushed away toward their base. He deactivated the lockdown protocol, and reported to his workstation. He then asked Kyzer, “Have we made progress on Project Achilles?”

Kyzer responded, “Yeah Jax, we’re done. We have successfully produced our first results.”

Jax said, “Excellent. I will report this to the queen and ask her for permission to use the  secret weapons.”

## Chapter 3

Jax rushed into the throne room. “Your Majesty, the Galacticans just attacked. You now are authorized to declare war. It was honestly perfect timing. Project Achilles is complete. Now, we only need your approval, and then we will bring the Galacticans to their knees!”

Liora responded, “Yes Jax, you have authorization. You may begin setting up the Achilles buildings.”
