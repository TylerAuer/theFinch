You think we don’t notice.  
You think we don’t see the glares you point towards us.  
Or the ignorance  
Or the stares  
Or the pity  
Or the looks of pure disgust

You think that we’re a disease, something contagious  
Although I guess that could be true  
At one point we just stop trying  
It happens to all of us  
It starts with efforts to make a living in this sorrowful world  
To leave this nightmare you watch like cartoons  
But day by day the darkness grows inside  
It becomes a gnawing pain  
All of that cruelty and ignorance taking a little bit of the human in you  
Until one day, there’s only a shell  
An empty body  
A hopeless, dead soul

What nobody understands is that we’re humans too  
We have a family  
We fell in love  
We went to school  
We laughed and cried and cared about things  
But that doesn’t matter to you

We lose “friends” daily  
Family turns on us  
People we trust leave  
Sometimes I wonder if I could stand up and be seen  
To walk around and shake hands and mingle without being avoided  
But then I return to reality, waking up from my fantasies, on the uneven concrete  
So maybe next time you see me, or any of us, give us a smile or even just a nod  
Every act of kindness, a glimpse of sunlight in the fog, means the world
