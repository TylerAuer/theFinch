There once was a little baboon
Who thought he could fly to the moon!
Attempted to fly,
And stopped – but why?
Did he need to come home soon?

Back to the earth he came,
He hoped that this might bring him fame!
He touched the ground,
And looked all around,
Was this place really the same?

He’d got it in his head –
He was on the moon instead!
He reached his prize!
But he opened his eyes,
To discover he was still in bed!

Sitting atop a pontoon
Was Jamie the little raccoon!
Completely carefree,
He sailed through the sea,
Drifting towards the full moon.

The sounds of his journey were hushed,
When suddenly he heard a rush.
He looked toward the moon,
Then back again soon,
For all he saw was a thrush.

Quickly he heard a crowd’s call,
Then he had understood all.
What he had thought to be
A glittering sea
Was not a sea but a fall!

He woke up in bed with a sweat.
“It was a dream!” he insisted, but yet,
He looked at his hair
With a horrified stare
And found it was thoroughly wet!
