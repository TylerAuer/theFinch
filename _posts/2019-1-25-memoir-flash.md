I stared down at the ground, my feet dangling off my bed, trying to figure out what the heck had just happened.

“Why did Dad just tell me we’re going to India?” I had just burst out to my mom minutes earlier. “There’s no freaking way I’m going. This is bull!” I had screamed at her, getting extremely emotional.

“Calm down and just let me explain,” she had soothingly said to me.

Taking a seat on her bed alongside me, she had said, “We got a call from an adoption agency for a little girl, just 3 or 4 years old.” My jaw had dropped wide open and in that moment, I was utterly shocked, not believing what I was hearing. Adoption had been at the back of all of our minds for the past few years, but I thought that by then, we had sort of let it slip. It had been a while since my mom had left, but I’d still sat there on my bed, stunned, like a deer in headlights. I was struggling to wrap my head around the idea of possibly adopting a little sister.

“What was this going to mean for me? Am I actually ready to be an older sister?” I had contemplated, as I sat alone in my room, the silence ringing in my ears.

It was a week later, we had arrived in India, and were going to visit the orphanage. I found myself subconsciously tapping my foot on the ground in a rhythm, scrolling through Instagram on my phone in the hotel lobby. My mom, also on her phone, was sitting on the couch with me. My dad had called for an Uber, but it was taking way too long with India’s terrible traffic, so the hotel was calling around, trying to find us a ride. We had just arrived in India early that morning and were on our way to the orphanage. “The autorickshaw will be here to pick you up any moment,” I overheard the receptionist inform my dad. “Oh no,” I thought to myself.

Wind blew through my hair, tangling it further in the typical humidity of India. I sighed, listening to the loud honking of cars in the typical India traffic. I leaned over on my mom’s shoulders and closed my eyes, praying that my headache would go away and this nightmare of a drive would soon be over. I started to doze away, still hearing the faint sound of honking cars in the background until we were all suddenly jerked forward by the sudden halt of the auto rickshaw. The driver parked across the street from the orphanage and as my dad paid and thanked him, I peered out the window taking a good look at the orphanage. There was a navy blue gate guarding the entrance, and a large white building standing behind. In between the two, was a little play area for the children, and two buildings on the side for a classroom and office. My mom signed into the visitor’s sign-in sheet and we walked straight ahead into the white building.

> "What was this going to mean for for me? Am I actually ready to be an older sister?" I had contemplated, as I sat alone in my room, the silence ringing in my ears.

It wasn’t very well maintained, probably because it was government funded. There were a bunch of small stone tables lined inside and a door leading into the next room. Many spider webs filled the cracks in the corners and spiraled to the ceiling. At the back of the room were all the orphans sitting peacefully and eating lunch. “Finish quickly!” the adoption lady scolded the kids. She seemed to be running the place and in charge of handling all affairs. After finishing, she pushed the little girl, Urvashi, to come to sit with us and talk. She was bent over, looking down at the ground, as she fiddled with her fingers and shyly made her way over to us.

“Hi! What’s your name?” my mom asked her, calmly. She timidly smiled, kept her head down, and didn’t respond. “Hey do you want chocolate?” my mom asked her, a huge smile on her face. Urvashi nodded and my mom handed a piece her a small Hershey’s Kiss.

After a long silence, my dad asked while pointing at me, “Do you want to sit on her lap?” She nodded once again and walked over to me. I smiled really widely, picked her up, and placed her on my lap. I couldn’t talk to her that much because of our language barrier. She could only speak and understand Hindi, and I couldn’t.

There was another long pause of silence, that was broken by the adoption lady smiling and suggesting, “Why don’t we go talk in my office?”

Shuffling through the mess of papers on her desk, she motioned for us to sit down and pulled out a file. She passed it over to my dad who opened it and started reading it. “Urvashi was abandoned at a train station six months ago,” she began, “and was found by the police soon after.” Urvashi remained on my lap, playing with a doll, not understanding what was going on. “After being questioned, the only things that she told them was her name and that she had an older brother and sister.” My eyes widened and I listened intently. “They later found out that her parents were poor farmers. We don’t know her exact age but we’re guessing she’s around 3 or 4.” I couldn’t believe what this poor little girl had been through. I wasn’t entirely sure how or why any of this happened to her, but I didn’t want to be the one to ask.

I was sitting on the bed in our hotel room and we were discussing the situation. “It’s tough,” I heard my mom say. Sighing, I looked up from my phone to join the conversation.

“Yeah, I don’t know,” my dad replied, looking down.

“Wait what happened?” I asked, just as my dad got a phone call. He picked up and walked to the other side of the room. I turned to face my mom and asked, “What’s going on?”

“I don’t know if we’re going to be able to say yes to adopting her.”

“What, why?”

“Well, you noticed she didn’t talk at all right?” she asked and I nodded. “We called a mental health professional and they said that with all the trauma she’s been through, being neglected by her parents, and being abandoned, she’ll most likely have a really hard time adjusting to living in the US. They said they’re going to look into it more, dad’s talking to them right now,” she told me. It was so much information to take in, I didn’t know what to do except nod and look away.

I thought for a little bit, “Why does that matter? It’ll eventually be ok. I don’t want to just say no to her because of that. I don’t want to abandon her.”

“Why does that matter though, mom? Can’t we take her in anyway?” I quietly asked her, trying to hold back tears. She could tell I was getting emotional again.

“I know sweetie, but it’s not easy for us or for you. We’re going to have to take her to therapy and spend so much time with her making sure she’s doing well. I don’t want to just leave you, especially not when you’re going into high school so soon. This is an important time in your life and we need to be there for you,” she told me, delivering a long monologue for me to process once again.

> I don't want to just say no to her because of that. I don't want to abandon her.

“OK,” I said, swallowing back tears, but it wasn’t enough. I felt my face getting hot and my eyes starting to get watery. My heart began beating faster as tears slowly streamed down my face and dropped into my lap. I wiped them away, one by one until I realized that I was hugging my mom and crying onto her shoulder. Everything felt unreal and I just wished to be home, in my own bed, with none of this ever happening.

My dad came back and sat on the bed, telling us what the doctor had said. “Yeah, it won’t be easy. I just don’t think it was meant to be.” The three of us sat in silence on the bed and mindlessly watched some trashy show that was playing on the hotel TV.

I sat on the bench and tied my shoes as we were getting ready to leave our hotel room. It was the next day and I knew it was going to be hard to go back to the orphanage again after our conversation the night before. We arrived, signed in, and went inside the white building once again. Just looking at it seemed so daunting, and the thought of going back in and having to see Urvashi was going to make me break down crying. I took a deep breath, trying to swallow back my tears, and walked in alongside my parents.

The kids were all in the back playing and getting ready for the day. They slowly began filing into the front yard, the older kids into either of the two classrooms, and the younger kids just sitting around with their toys. My parents and I followed them to the front and sat down on the steps leading into the building. My mom pulled out some colored pencils and paper she had brought, and gave it to three of the kids gathered around us, one of them was Urvashi. They smiled at us and began scribbling on the paper.

After a few minutes, my mom asked, “Okay who can write the letter A?”

”Me!” they all yelled out and started their attempts at writing an A. We went back and forth like this for a while, watching them so happy made me get a bit emotional. I glanced over at Urvashi, she was smiling and drawing on the paper, she seemed so perfect at that moment.

“Hey, what’s your name?” I asked her in Hindi, out of the blue. I was truly hoping that she would say something this time.

She stared at me for a solid second, looking extremely confused, then she yelled out, “URVASHI!”

I was overjoyed and so proud of her as I said, “Good job!” It was in that moment that I remembered we weren’t adopting her. Maybe getting too attached to her wasn’t the greatest idea. I subconsciously smiled at her and watched her continue to draw. She had become so much more open and talkative after just one day, but it still wasn’t enough. Deep down, I knew that this wouldn’t make a difference to our decision, and it was final. As we left, about an hour later, I could feel my heart ripping into millions of tiny little pieces, each and every one of them aching so much. I smiled as sincerely as possible as I waved goodbye to her, forever.

Cradled in my mom’s arms, I was lying on her lap, tears trickling down my face. We stayed in silence on the bed in her room for a while. “I miss her so much.” I sat up and turned to look at her. “I feel awful. It just hurts so much,” I told her as I swallowed, trying to hold back more tears from pouring down my face. I couldn’t express in words how much pain I was going through, and it seemed like nobody else would ever understand.

“I know sweetie, I know,” she told me, gently tugging me back down to her lap. It had been a little less than a week since we had gotten back from India. The whole experience was so overwhelming for all of us. Each day, I’d go back into my mom’s room and say the same thing. Then my mom and I would sit together in silence, I’d be crying, and she’d be comforting me. It took me a long time to finally heal from this experience, but deep down, some small part of me never did. Before our trip, I couldn’t believe that we were going and it took me so long to wrap my head around the idea of adopting a little sister. But now, it’s so hard to imagine a life where I had never met her. It’s amazing what an impact she made on my life after just two days. I still think about her and how different my life would be in this very moment if we had said that word. Just that one single word: yes.
