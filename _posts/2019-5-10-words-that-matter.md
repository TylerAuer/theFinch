**Wyatt Darke ‘19:** What does a book mean to you? Is it a written memory, or just a stupid stack of paper? To me, a book is a journey. Not with pictures, or voices, but with words. You see, a book is what you make it. You could read a book as nothing but a requirement, but you could also feel the book. You can travel with the characters, seeing what they see in your head, and creating environments to your own creative limit. Books allow you to think, and have time to do that thinking.

Imagine a two hour movie. Two hours. That’s it. With a book, you can extend that time to as long as you want. Books allow you to see things before the characters can. In movies it’s more of, “Don’t go around that corner!” and less of, “This is where the characters first run into the main antagonist.”

Books also hold stories from the past. They give us new information and facts, but also tell stories people may not have heard before. Sometimes these are stories that should have been told a long time ago. Books are filled with treasure only found by those who choose to read them.

Books are my main source of knowledge. Most of that knowledge cannot be gained from movies. Have you seen Harry Potter? What do you imagine when you think of him? I imagine Daniel Radcliffe. Why? Because of movie posters. Books don’t do that. They give you the opportunity to make the story how YOU want to see it. They give you a creative choice, and there’s freedom in that. It’s your decision whether you make that choice or not.

**Sonny R. Elmerick ’19:** The compelling graphic novel, _March: Book One_, was written by Andrew Aydin, Nate Powell, and Congressman John Lewis.

The novel depicts the fascinating and eye-opening journey of the African American movement and specifically, John Lewis, and his contributions to our modern society. Book One focuses on Lewis’s childhood lessons, influential people who inspired Lewis, and the nonviolent protests — Sit-Ins — that Lewis participated in. The book is told from the point of view of Congressman John Lewis, flashing back to his memories of the movement, the movement to desegregate everything, from lunch counters to public schools. Book One ends with their small goal of desegregating lunch counters succeeding; a small step towards ending discrimination.

The book uses eye-catching drawings to help depict a scene and set a mood. Some of the images even teach you something that words can’t explain: pain, suffering, and joy. Although this book has some setbacks like the explicit language, I feel as though it is only right to use the language that was actually said when it happened because it helps you understand the hardships they went through

All in all, this book taught me a lesson of determination: to reach your desired destination, you must have courage, both in yourself and the people you trust; you must have an unwavering determination, both in yourself and the cause you are fighting for.

Although I have only read Book One out of three, I give this book a 5 out of 5 for its outstanding and intriguing story, told from the point of view of someone who actually went through everything told in the book. I feel there is no better story than a story from the point of view from someone who actually went through the events.

> I've had a pretty touch year, and I've learned a lot about sadness. But it is really nothing compared to Anne's situation.

**Georgia Starr ’20:** A book that changed me was _The Diary of Anne Frank_. Before I read the book, I knew a little bit about persecution of Jewish people from history TV channels and snippets from stories my dad told me. At the time, I didn’t really know what pain was and wasn’t thinking about the way it would have been so emotionally hard for Anne. When I read it, I really felt like I was there. The writing was just really powerful. It was so deep – it made me feel so sad for Anne and what she was going through because at her age, she should have been enjoying life.

During World War II certain groups of people were being persecuted, and it kind of proves that it really should be diverse people that rule rather than a powerful few. If Anne had lived through the experience, she could have had a happy family, her dream job, and get to travel. At least with her short life she left a mark. Despite everything, Anne fought and helped other people by documenting everything for the future.

I really liked _Diary of Anne Frank_ because through all the horrible experiences that happened to her she was really brave and strong and she didn’t break under pressure. It was really amazing how mature she was at that age. I don’t think other people would be that way. It helped me as a young girl reading it in the “future.”

I’ve had a pretty tough year, and I’ve learned a lot about sadness, but it is really nothing compared to Anne’s situation. It taught me to be more grateful about the things I have and to take advantage of all the opportunities that I am given and can do in this life. Diary of Anne Frank changed me because I now have a better outlook on life, and if I’m in a bad situation I now think about how I can make it better rather than give up or complain. Don’t take life for granted because we all have it better than people like her did, and it makes me feel grateful and less stubborn about unimportant things.

This book also brought me closer to my mom. I read the Diary of Anne Frank before going to the Philippines where my mom grew up. The area is really poor, and it helped me connect to my mom because she read it when she was having a hard time. It gave her the strength and inspiration to continue, and it does the same for me.

There are some human rights that everyone should have. You should have the right to practice your own religion and have your own gender beliefs. You should have the right to rise out of poverty. Be whoever you want to be and don’t criticise others for what they believe and practice. I learned that from the book, Diary of Anne Frank. I don’t know if Anne got to be who she wanted to be. If you restrict a person, they aren’t actually “there,” and that person could have made a big mark on the world. So religion and identity and poverty should not be restrictions. You have to let people rise above and be who they are, so they can make a difference.

Ruby Rocker ’19: The book March is by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell. It is the story of how they got equal rights for African Americans in the United States. It’s very inspiring and the graphics are exceptional. The book starts off with John Lewis and Hosea Williams leading the Bloody Sunday march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965. It then flashes forward to 2009, where John Lewis was in his office getting ready for Barack Obama’s first presidential inauguration. An African American woman and her two sons suddenly walk into his office because she wanted to show them their history and how far they’ve come. Happily, John Lewis tells the two boys about his life story, from growing up on a farm and all the things he learned, to protesting with nonviolence and doing sit-ins to make a change in the world around him. The book ends with a final flashback to when Dr. King delivered a speech about making city history after all the sit-ins at lunch counters.

> A single drawing can tell a story in this book, and there's so much to analyze in each one.

In my opinion, _March_ did a really great job with graphics. They were extremely detailed and very precise. Even though they were done in black and white, the drawings portrayed lots of emotion and set a really great scene. I was able to tell what was happening even when there was no dialogue. One example of this is when John Lewis was going on a trip with his uncle. There were minimal dialogues and captions, but the drawings showed how scared they were when crossing through certain states and how relieved they were when they arrived. A single drawing can tell a story in this book and there’s so much to analyze in each one.

I think that one weakness this book had was that it rushed through the story a bit too fast. There was a lot more that they could’ve included but didn’t. For example, I would’ve liked to know more about their nonviolence training before they started sit-ins. It would’ve been nice to learn more about that. Additionally, I wish they’d added more details about the different organizations (CORE, NAACP, SCLC, SNCC).

Overall, I believe this book was amazing and is definitely worth the read! I’d give it a 5 out of 5. I was truly moved by the story and struggles of the characters in this book and it helped me to realize how lucky I am to live in the world I do, with all the privileges I have. I go to school with a very accepting community and I’m free to be who I want to be. It also put into perspective how hard they had to fight for their freedom and it was so inspiring to see how strong they were no matter what. I aspire to be like that someday. I’m really glad I read this book, and I would 100% recommend it!
