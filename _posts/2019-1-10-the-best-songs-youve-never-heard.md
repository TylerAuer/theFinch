**Mr. Auer:** Like most people, I find that I’m attracted to activities for which I display some initial ability. Running and catching was natural, so I took up Football. Kicking seemed to lead directly to multiple days of knee pain, so soccer was out. Music is a notable outlier in this pattern.

Despite a vocal range falling below baritone but above donkey and a musical career that peaked with a widely panned performance of Hot Crossed Buns on the recorder in third grade, I nevertheless find myself enthralled by music. I listen to music while I’m working, driving, eating, cleaning, cooking, and at pretty much any other time when I can get away with it. It can amplify my mood or help me to block out distractions. But, often, it’s more: part of me in a way that I can’t quite explain.

For a college art class I once created a number of atypical self portraits. One piece was a wall-sized, handwritten list of my entire iTunes music library — this being the time before everyone had unlimited access to any song they wanted through Spotify. For college-aged me, my music collection wasn’t just my current listening preferences, it was a portrait of who I was. That feeling still rings true to me today.

I am constantly searching for new music to become part of me. This post is the first in a series selfishly designed to help me (and you too if you are still reading) discover new artists, genres, and jams. In each post I’ll invite members of the community to share their favorite songs and the best songs they don’t think others know . I’ll start.

My favorite song is Out on the Weekend by Neil Young. As a child, my family traveled from New England to Jackson, Wyoming each August. We’d fly in catching our first glance of The Tetons off the starboard wing. Arriving at our accommodations my mother would immediately hit play on the same CD of Neil Young’s greatest hits. This trip was my favorite week of the year, and Young’s voice was the soundtrack.

As I grew older and explored his work on my own, this opening track from Harvest quickly grew into my favorite song. The gentle guitar and drums gets my head nodding before the incredible harmonica takes off, making me feel all of the feels. There’s magic in the way Young’s lyrics match the emotions of the harmonica as he describes trying to start anew in California. I’ve listened to this song hundreds and hundreds of time. I sing it to my daughter before bed. It will never get old.

The best song you’ve never heard of is Remember to Remember by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes. ES&MZ holds a special place in my heart: my wife and I recessed from our wedding ceremony to her friends performing That’s What’s Up. And, Remember to Remember may be the single most powerful vocal performance I’ve ever heard.

Like so many of their songs, Remember to Remember begins slowly and builds in energy as more of the large band joins in on varied instruments and on backup vocals. But, this song is really all about the singing of Jade Castrinos. It’s all power and fervor as she belts out “Just remember this/You don’t walk alone,” wrapping you up in her conviction. This song is never a light listen, but it is always incredible.

**Annika Gray ’19:** My favorite song is Respect by Aretha Franklin (originally by Otis Redding). I’ve always had a love for soul and R&B music and I definitely believe that The Queen of Soul, perfectly channeled her love into this song. Although it’s a simple song, the passion in her voice is demanding yet inspiring. There are also some subtle nuances between the lyrics of the two versions, mainly Franklin redirecting some of the lines towards empowering herself and women.

The best song you’ve never heard is New Person, Same ‘Ol Mistakes by Tame Impala. Rihanna covered this song in 2016, but it never stuck out to me because there were other songs on her album Anti that I liked more. Then I remembered seeing someone on YouTube do a jazz guitar cover of New Person, Same ‘Ol Mistakes by Tame Impala and I was confused. So I looked the Tame Impala version up and listened to it. I was immediately sucked into the quirky layered pop sounds that were already familiar to me but somehow had a completely different vibe. The powerful lyrics also showcase a contrast between not caring what his listeners think (in the beginning) with a completely different subject of having a pessimistic mental battle over love.

**George Kimrich ’20:** My favorite song is (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction. When I was poking around for some new music, I stumbled on The Rolling Stones. I checked them out and the first song I listened to was Satisfaction. The opening riff hooked me immediately. I thought it couldn’t get better until Mick Jagger’s voice came in. His soft voice with the distorted guitar was a great combo.

I have spent countless nights with my family in the bedroom playing a board game or drawing with that song playing in the background. I’ve practically memorized this song by heart.

The special thing about this song is that you could be anywhere, in any mood, and this song would work perfectly.

The best song you’ve never heard of is Slave by The Rolling Stones. This song is the perfect headbanger to pump you up. The distorted power chords in the beginning are amazing, and when Mick Jagger starts yelling/singing it really makes your body sway inside. This song has a talent that no other song can do. I really don’t know why it isn’t a number one hit for The Stones. The cowbell and sick beat from the drums channel rock and a little blues. This song is amazingly written and deserves more recognition. It will never get old and will never quiet down.
