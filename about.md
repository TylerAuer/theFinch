<span class="dropcap">A</span> finch is a clever bird most notable for its ability to adapt to dynamic environments. They are small and inconspicuous in both color and song. It is their actions; the choices they make that set these birds apart. There are finches that use tools, crack nuts, dig holes and mimic the behavior of other animals in order to survive. Finches are bright, curious, hardy and tough, adaptable and resilient members of their ever changing world.

In our first few weeks of life, the Saint Andrew’s Writing Club was searching for a name and outlet to display our work. While we had many excited and willing middle school writers, we did not have a unifying identity. The symbol of Saint Andrew’s is an oak tree, and much of the literature coming from the school uses this concept in their titles. The Oak is the biannual magazine, “The Leaflet” is the weekly newsletter. The lower school has a fantastic newspaper enthusiastically called, The Acorn. All of these names realize the nature of the Saint Andrew’s community of learners, rooted around the symbol of our school.

> This space is theirs to build and inspire as part of our rooted and loving school community, while also celebrating that, like all birds, they must someday fly away and find new trees.

We had some uncertainty about where we fit into the scheme of published school literature. So, as writers will do, we turned to some of our favorite authors for inspiration. J.K. Rowling, through her beloved character Albus Dumbledore said, “It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” When the Saint Andrew’s writers made a list of our intentions for the club, a few ambitions surfaced. These are collaborative middle schoolers, hopeful and eager to share their creativity and artwork with the world beyond the nurturing branches of their school. They are young adults with voices that need a platform that reflects their growing maturity, responsibility, and awareness. A website, sophisticated in character and function, was the obvious choice. The intentional practice of digital citizenship and online safety, a benefit.

<span class="dropcap">At</span> Saint Andrew’s Episcopal School, middle schoolers are the oldest students. Many members of the Writing Club have been here since pre-K, and are about to embark on the next steps of their educational adventure. Writing Club members pointed out this platform will be a legacy for middle schoolers growing up and leaving Saint Andrew’s. They wanted a name that acknowledged and celebrated their bittersweet graduation into high school. What title would fit our writing platform, accomplishing all these strong intentions?

> Quite suddenly, there it was, obvious and perfect. We knew who we were.

Two events happened simultaneously. The science classroom, headquarters to the Writing Club’s recess meetings, was studying evolution and adopted finches as class pets. At our next meeting, still struggling to find a name for ourselves, we again sought inspiration from our favorite authors. Sir J.M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan, wrote, “The moment we doubt we can fly, we cease forever to be able to do it.” Quite suddenly, there it was, obvious and perfect. We knew who we were.

The Finch is a site with the purpose of celebrating the “flight,” or bravery and creativity of Saint Andrew’s middle school writers and the teams of volunteers who edit and publish the work. While teacher encouraged and supervised, this website is contributed to and run by students. This space is theirs to build and inspire as part of our rooted and loving school community, while also celebrating that like all birds, they must someday fly away and find new trees. We are proud of our middle school writers, will always save the work they publish here, and will celebrate the new contributions of future writers for years to come. The names of our authors are pseudonymous, but the work is authentically their own. Welcome to The Finch.
